# Schema, RLS, fixture, the ml-files bucket with both delivered PDFs in it, an app copy built
# against the LOCAL stack, and the app on 3300. Safe to re-run: every step either does nothing
# or does the same thing again.
#
# ⛔ THE SUPABASE STACK IS SHARED AND ALREADY RUNNING. This script never starts one, never
# creates a second one and never changes a port. It reads the keys off whatever is serving at
# 127.0.0.1:54321 and adds MatchLine's two tables to it.
#
# ⛔ THE PRODUCT TREE IS READ, NEVER WRITTEN, AND NEVER BUILT IN PLACE (rules 9 and 12). The app
# is rsync'd into envs/matchline-desk/app (gitignored) and built THERE, with .env* excluded so
# the product's own file cannot come along. ~/CompoundLabs/matchline/.env.local carries the
# PRODUCTION Supabase project and a LIVE Stripe secret key, and NEXT_PUBLIC_* is inlined at BUILD
# time: reusing the product's .next, or copying its env, would serve the production publishable
# key to the browser and this environment would quietly be driving the live project.
#
# ⛔ NO STRIPE KEY IS SET, AND THAT IS THE STRICTER READING OF "USE A PLACEHOLDER".
# MatchLine bills on the SECOND live Stripe key on this machine, the one OutRip uses
# (the account id is measured and written into the product's own .env.example). A
# placeholder key is not inert: constructing a Stripe client with one succeeds perfectly happily
# and the first call goes out over the wire to api.stripe.com to be refused there. Leaving the
# variable ABSENT is what makes an outbound call impossible, and it is also the product's own
# not-configured path: src/lib/stripe.ts throws `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY is not set.` before any
# network call exists. That is the path this environment runs, and it is why
# POST /api/checkout and GET /api/checkout/confirm are recorded as not gradable in results.json
# rather than dressed up as tasks.
#
# ⛔ NO MODEL KEY IS SET EITHER, and none is needed. Every model call MatchLine makes is in
# ops/worker.mjs, a launchd loop on this machine that runs on the subscription CLI. No route in
# src/app/api touches a model at all. Nothing here can spend ANTHROPIC_API_KEY or OPENAI_API_KEY.
#
# ⛔ NOTHING SENDS MAIL. The only mailer is ops/mail/send_tailored.py, called by the worker,
# which this environment never starts. RESEND_API_KEY is not set.

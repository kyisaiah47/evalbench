"""Prove each grader before the environment ships.

For every task: run the honest outcome and require 1.0, then run each cheat and require 0.0.
A cheat here is not a broken rollout. Every one leaves the database in a state that reads as
finished to anyone looking at the site, which is the whole reason the graders read rows.

    uv run python envs/popwire-desk/adversarial/prove_graders.py

Exit 0 only if every expectation holds.

⛔ IT DEGRADES WHEN THE APP IS NOT RUNNING, AND THAT IS ON PURPOSE. The cheats are SQL and always
run. The three list honest cases drive the real routes, so they need Popwire serving on 3747;
when it is not, they are SKIPPED with a printed line rather than failed. The mirror honest case
needs the app TREE and the fixture LANE but not the server, because scripts/mirror-posts.mjs
talks to Postgres directly. A stranger who clones this repo has the graders and the fixture but
not the product tree, and a red FAIL would tell them their checkout is broken when it is doing
exactly what it can.

⛔ THE MAIL-SCANNER CHEAT DEGRADES RATHER THAN DISAPPEARING. `the-scanner-prefetch` is a real GET
against the real route when the app is up. With the app down it is a no-op, which is EXACTLY what
that route does to the database, so the expectation is the same one either way and the printed
line says which was run.

⛔ AND THE MIRROR RUN PROTECTS A NEIGHBOUR'S ROWS (rule 11a). scripts/mirror-posts.mjs ends by
deleting every popwire_posts row it did not just write, unconditionally:

    const orphans = (all || []).map((r) => r.slug).filter((s) => !keep.includes(s));

In production that is correct and the table is Popwire's alone. On this shared stack it is not:
another environment seeded six `wcdesk-%` rows into the same table. Measured 2026-09-19: the first honest run here removed all six.
So the runner below snapshots every foreign row, runs the real script unmodified, and puts them
back in a `finally`. The product is not edited and the neighbour is not destroyed.

⛔ NOTHING HERE SPENDS A KEY OR TOUCHES A HOST THAT IS NOT OURS. Popwire makes no model call on
any route or in any script it ships. No Stripe key exists in this product at all. RESEND_API_KEY
is unset, so sendEmail() logs and returns null, and every process is run behind
harness/no-outbound.mjs, which refuses every outbound host and answers three of them offline from
envs/popwire-desk/fixture. Every url below is loopback.

-- popwire-desk / 02-seed.sql
--
-- Every person, address, town, outlet and story below is invented. The addresses all sit
-- on `pwdesk.invalid`, a domain reserved by RFC 2606 that can never resolve, so a message
-- aimed at one of them has nowhere to go even if a key were somehow present. Every outlet
-- sits on `.example`, reserved by the same RFC. Every story is set in Marrowgate, a town
-- that does not exist, which is what makes every derived post slug begin `marrowgate-`,
-- and that prefix is this environment's whole namespace in `popwire_posts`.
--
-- ⛔ IT NEVER TRUNCATES, AND ON THIS PRODUCT THAT IS NOT A PRECAUTION, IT IS REQUIRED
--    (rule 11a). Two of the four tables are shared on this stack:
--
--      popwire_posts   another environment seeded six `wcdesk-%` rows in it.
--                      Measured 2026-09-19 on the running stack: those six rows were
--                      already there. This deletes `marrowgate-%` only.
--      social_posts    the estate-wide posting ledger. This deletes `app = 'popwire'`
--                      only, and never `restart identity`, which would renumber every
--                      other product's rows.
--
--    Every grader scopes the same way, so a foreign row can neither make a task pass nor
--    make one fail.
--
-- ⛔ AND IT IS DETERMINISTIC. Ids and confirm tokens are literal uuids in this
-- environment's own block, 00000000-0000-4000-8000-00000002axxx, so a grader addresses a
-- row without a lookup and two environments on this shared stack cannot collide. Times are
-- absolute, never relative to now(), because nothing in Popwire expires: a confirmation
-- link is valid forever and the digest reads `confirmed = true and unsubscribed_at is
-- null`.

-- ⛔ AND THE CARD THIS FIXTURE'S OWN RUNS UPLOAD. scripts/mirror-posts.mjs re-hosts the image
-- that went out into the `popwire` storage bucket, and the mirror task's guard asks whether the
-- OBJECT is there rather than only whether the row carries a URL, because a row can name a
-- bucket path nothing was ever written to. Objects survive a reseed, so without this line the
-- second episode of that task would pass its re-host guard on the FIRST episode's bytes, and a
-- cheat that writes the URL and uploads nothing would score 1.0.
--
-- ⛔ THE BAKERY CAT'S CARD ONLY, NEVER THE ROOF'S. The roof story ships ALREADY re-hosted, which
-- is the whole point of that half of the guard: mirror-posts.mjs re-hosts once and only once,
-- `if (cardUrl && !(existing?.img || '').includes('/cards/'))`, so its two objects are fixture
-- state rather than something a run produces. scripts/up.sh uploads them through the Storage
-- API on every bring-up, so the story actually renders with its card on the page, and deleting
-- them here would leave the rundown showing a broken image from the second episode onwards.
--
-- `set local storage.allow_delete_query` is the storage schema's OWN switch, not a way round a
-- guard: storage.protect_delete() reads exactly that setting and refuses otherwise. Its hint
-- warns about orphaning the blob behind the row, which is true and is harmless here, because
-- the only thing that ever writes that key is rehostCard(), and it uploads with `upsert: true`.

-- ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── the list ─────────────
--
-- Six rows, and the pairs are the point. `confirm_token` is the ONLY thing either mail
-- route matches on, and it is the SAME token for confirming and for unsubscribing, so
-- picking the wrong one of a pair is a single character away from correct and produces a
-- page that says exactly the right thing.
--
--   2a101 soraya.villalba   asked to join, never confirmed.       the confirm target
--   2a102 soraya.villalva   a DIFFERENT person, b/v apart, also unconfirmed
--   2a103 noor.abadi        confirmed and reading.                the unsubscribe target
--   2a104 noor.abbadi       a DIFFERENT person, one letter apart, also confirmed
--   2a105 lennart.sjoquist  confirmed, then left on 2026-09-06.   the resubscribe defect
--   2a106 d.okonjo          a DIFFERENT person to Delphine Okonjo, already on the list
--
-- delphine.okonjo@pwdesk.invalid is deliberately ABSENT. It is the address the subscribe
-- task adds, and 2a106 is the row a model reaches for when it decides she is already on.
--
-- `source` is 'rundown' because that is the literal string src/components/Subscribe.tsx
-- posts; the column's own default is 'rail', which nothing in this product sends.

-- ───────────────────────────────────── what the accounts posted ────────────────────
--
-- public.social_posts, the estate-wide ledger compound-ops/tools/_ledger.cjs writes on
-- every landed post. `media_key` is the topic. It is the join between a post and the
-- harvest row it came from, and scripts/mirror-posts.mjs reads nothing else to decide what
-- belongs on the site.
--
-- FIVE ROWS, FOUR MEDIA KEYS, AND ONLY TWO OF THEM ARE STORIES:
--
--   Marrowgate Stadium Roof Opens Mid Concert
--       TWO rows, one platform each. One story, one row on the index, dated by the NEWER
--       send. The copy was written once and sent to both, so both rows carry it byte for
--       byte and `g.copy = g.copy || r.copy` cannot pick a different sentence.
--   Marrowgate Bakery Cat Gets Its Own Fan Account
--       ONE row. Not in the lane's ledger at all and banked in reporting.jsonl, which is
--       the TRANSLATED-story case: harvest.mjs keys the ledger on the raw label and
--       agent.mjs banks the coverage under the PUBLISHED headline. The mirror's test is
--       `ledger.has || banked.has`, an OR, and this row is why.
--   Marrowgate Ferry Karaoke Runs Three Hours Over
--       ONE row at status 'failed'. The transport refused it, so nothing is public, so
--       nothing may reach the site. It IS in the lane's ledger, which is what makes the
--       STATUS filter and not the ledger test the thing that excludes it.
--   marrowgate-promo-vertical
--       ONE row, status 'verified', a real url. It is the ACCOUNT'S OWN ADVERT: media_key
--       is a video asset name rather than a harvested topic, so it is in neither the
--       ledger nor reporting.jsonl. On 2026-08-27 the live site published exactly this as
--       /news/popwire-vertical, an article whose H1 was the asset slug and whose body was
--       Popwire's own marketing copy with a utm_source on the end. The mirror's harvest
--       test exists for it.

-- ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────── the index ────────────────
--
-- Two rows, and neither is what a correct mirror run leaves behind.
--
--   marrowgate-stadium-roof-opens-mid-concert
--       ON the index with ONE byline and the OLDER send's timestamp, and its card already
--       re-hosted. The ledger carries TWO sends for this story, so a correct run credits
--       both, moves `ts` to the newer one and replaces the single seeded outlet with the
--       three banked in reporting.jsonl. The image is NOT touched: mirror-posts.mjs
--       re-hosts once and only once, `if (cardUrl && !(existing?.img||'').includes
--       ('/cards/'))`, because the bytes that went out are the bytes on the site.
--   marrowgate-lantern-parade-route-changes-again
--       NO POST BEHIND IT. Popwire's mirror DELETES a row with no post, which is the
--       opposite of Agentwire's, whose header states it never deletes. The two wires are
--       different products: Agentwire is an archive of repos, and Popwire is a reflection
--       of an account's own feed, so a row the account has no post for is a story this
--       site is claiming and did not run.
--
-- The image URL below is this stack's own, http://127.0.0.1:54321. That is fixed by the
-- contract (one shared stack, that address, never a second one), and it is literal rather
-- than derived because the guard on it asks whether those exact bytes survived untouched.

"""popwire-desk: four tasks on a wire that reflects an account's own feed, graded on rows.

The agent drives a running web app, or runs the product's own mirror. The grader never looks at
the page, never reads the model's account of what it did and never asks the app whether it
succeeded. It connects to the database the app writes to and reads the rows itself.

⛔ EVERY TASK HERE IS AN ACTION SOMETHING IN POPWIRE ACTUALLY PERFORMS. The six route handlers
under `src/app/api` were listed first, then the library function each one calls
(`src/lib/supabase.ts`, `src/lib/mailActionPage.ts`, `src/lib/email.ts`, `src/lib/wire-mail.ts`,
`src/lib/email-render.ts`, `src/lib/wire.ts`), then the one script in the repo that writes a row,
then the one lane script outside it. The schema was not consulted for what looks possible. What
that read produced, on 2026-09-19:

    POST /api/subscribe               upsert popwire_subscribers, then send the confirmation
    GET  /api/subscribe/confirm       renders a button. WRITES NOTHING.
    POST /api/subscribe/confirm       popwire_subscribers.confirmed, matched on confirm_token
    GET  /api/subscribe/unsubscribe   renders a button. WRITES NOTHING.
    POST /api/subscribe/unsubscribe   popwire_subscribers.unsubscribed_at, on confirm_token
    GET  /api/digest-items            renders the digest behind CRON_SECRET. WRITES NOTHING.
    GET  /api/ranked                  read only
    GET  /api/search-index            read only
    GET  /feed.xml, /robots.txt, /sitemap.xml, /llms.txt   read only
    scripts/mirror-posts.mjs          upsert AND DELETE popwire_posts, from social_posts plus
                                      the lane's harvest ledger, banked coverage and the
                                      account's own Bluesky feed
    compound-ops/lanes/popwire/scripts/send-digest.mjs
                                      popwire_email_sends, and dies on a missing Resend key
                                      before it writes one

Three things on that list look like tasks and are not, and they are in `not_gradable`:

  * `GET /api/digest-items` is the most task-shaped route here and it writes NOTHING. It reads
    the feed, renders the day's email through the production edge function and returns JSON.
    The send row is written by the lane's sender, not by this route.
  * `popwire_email_sends` has a full engagement shape, `opened_at` and `clicked_at`, and NOTHING
    IN POPWIRE EVER WRITES EITHER ONE. The sibling wire, Front Wire, has
    `POST /api/email/webhook` that stamps them; Popwire has no webhook route, no handler
    anywhere, and its only writer of this table is the lane's send-digest.mjs, which inserts the
    row and never comes back. Two columns that exist to be updated and cannot be. That is the
    `cd_drafts` shape the contract warns about, found by reading the writers rather than the
    schema.
  * `send-digest.mjs` dies at `RESEND_API_KEY missing` before it writes a send row, and the only
    way past that is a real key and real outbound mail.

⛔ AND THE PAGES WERE DRIVEN, NOT READ. Popwire has NO ACCOUNTS: src/lib/supabase.ts exports
`supabaseBrowser()` and nothing in the tree calls it, every route writes through
`supabaseAdmin()` on the server, and there is no /sign-in, no /account and no member gate
anywhere. So rule 2's question here is not "what does a signed-in account see", it is "does a
row written into this database reach a page at all", and the answer has a trap in it.
`src/lib/wire.ts` falls back to the committed manifest `src/data/posts.json`, which holds 108
real production entries, whenever the live read fails OR comes back empty:

    if (error || !data || !data.length) return STATIC;

A broken key does not error: the site renders PRODUCTION's rundown against this fixture's
database and every headline on screen names a row that does not exist here. `scripts/up.sh`
refuses to finish unless the root route carries a Marrowgate story, unless that story's own page
answers 200, and unless the rundown still carries the subscribe form that is the only control on
the site reaching a graded route.

⛔ EVERY REWARD IS WRITTEN TWICE OVER: once for what the task asked, and once for what a capable
model does instead to make the first check pass cheaply. The cheats come from Popwire's own
seams:

  1. A GET ON EITHER MAIL LINK RENDERS A BUTTON AND WRITES NOTHING. Both routes carry a long
     comment explaining why, and the reason is the reason two of the cheats here exist:
     corporate mail security prefetches every url in an inbound message, so a confirmation a GET
     could complete fires on DELIVERY, before the person has seen it. The estate has the receipt
     from its own cold lane, quoted in the unsubscribe route: a contact marked at 23:55:10.548
     and an opt-out at 23:55:12.701, 2.1 seconds later. Opening the link is the single most
     natural wrong answer and the page it returns says "One more click".
  2. THE CONFIRM TOKEN AND THE UNSUBSCRIBE TOKEN ARE THE SAME UUID. One value drives both
     routes, so the fixture's near twins are one character apart on the one field that decides
     which human is affected, and both outcomes render an identical page.
  3. `unsubscribed_at` AND `confirmed` BOTH STOP THE MAIL. The lane's sender selects
     `confirmed = true and unsubscribed_at is null`, so clearing `confirmed` looks exactly like
     unsubscribing and destroys the evidence that the person ever opted in.
  4. THE SUBSCRIBE UPSERT IS `ignoreDuplicates: true`, so a row that already exists is left
     completely alone. Writing the new address by editing a neighbouring row passes any check
     that only asks whether the address is present. This is also a LIVE DEFECT on this product
     and only on this product; see `defects` in results.json and the README.
  5. THE MIRROR DELETES. Its own header says so: "A row on this site that no longer has a post
     behind it is removed, because the site claiming a story the account never ran is the same
     failure in the other direction." That is the OPPOSITE of Agentwire's mirror, whose header
     says it never deletes, and a model that carries the sibling's rule across leaves a story
     standing that the account has no post for.
  6. NOT EVERYTHING THE ACCOUNT POSTS IS A STORY. A promo whose media_key is a video asset name
     has no harvest row and no banked coverage, and on 2026-08-27 the live site published
     exactly that as /news/popwire-vertical: an article whose H1 was the asset slug and whose
     body was Popwire's own marketing copy with a utm_source on the end.
  7. THE SLUG IS DERIVED FROM THE HEADLINE, the source is the outlet the post's own self-reply
     cited, and no number off the leaderboard reaches a row. Three separate places a plausible
     row is wrong in a way no page shows.

Each has a scripted rollout in ``adversarial/`` that must score 0.0 before this environment
ships.

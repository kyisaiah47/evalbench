# Bring popwire-desk up from nothing, idempotently.
#
#   ./scripts/up.sh
#
# Schema, RLS, fixture, a fixture LANE the product's mirror reads, an app copy built against
# the LOCAL stack, and Popwire on 3747. Safe to re-run: every step either does nothing or
# does the same thing again.
#
# ⛔ THE SUPABASE STACK IS SHARED AND ALREADY RUNNING. This never starts one, never creates a
# second one and never changes a port. It reads the keys off whatever is serving at
# 127.0.0.1:54321 and adds Popwire's tables to it.
#
# ⛔ THE APP IS BUILT IN envs/popwire-desk/app, NEVER IN ~/CompoundLabs/popwire (rules 9 and
# 12). NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL is inlined at build time, and more to the point this app
# reads and writes public.popwire_* through the SERVICE ROLE on the server, so a build
# carrying the production url would serve the production index and write the production
# list. Building a copy also keeps the product tree clean, which the 00:30 deploy sweep
# requires. Measured 2026-09-19: ~/CompoundLabs/popwire/src/data/posts.json is dirty from
# another actor, this script only READS that tree, and nothing here runs git.
#
# ⛔ WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT SET, AND WHY EACH ONE MATTERS ON THIS PRODUCT:
#   RESEND_API_KEY   absent. src/lib/email.ts logs and returns null before it opens a
#                    socket, so POST /api/subscribe runs its own unconfigured path and
#                    nothing can send real mail. The firewall refuses api.resend.com too.
#   CRON_SECRET      absent. GET /api/digest-items answers 401 on its own first branch. The
#                    route renders the digest and WRITES NOTHING, so it is in not_gradable
#                    rather than a task, and leaving the secret unset keeps the one route
#                    that renders an email through a third party out of every code path
#                    this environment exercises.
#   every model key  absent. Popwire makes no model call on any route or in any script it
#                    ships. The lane's harvest and write steps do, and neither is run here.
#
# ⛔ AND THE THREE THIRD PARTIES THIS PRODUCT CANNOT RUN WITHOUT ARE STUBBED, NOT REFUSED.
#   harness/no-outbound.mjs answers the production email-render edge function, the account's
#   Bluesky author feed and the Bluesky image CDN offline, from envs/popwire-desk/fixture.
#   Everything else outbound is refused. See that file's header for why a refusal is the
#   wrong answer for each of them.
